## Introduction
Forest fires pose a significant danger to both human settlements and forest ecosystems worldwide, with their occurrence largely linked to human activities. The resulting devastation often includes climatic changes and the exacerbation of the greenhouse effect. To mitigate these negative impacts, it is crucial to identify forest fires early on. This study suggests a wireless sensor network system and approach that can detect forest fires at their initial stages.
