## Introduction
Forest fires pose a significant danger to both human settlements and forest ecosystems worldwide, with their occurrence largely linked to human activities. While many plants and animals need and benefit from wildfires, climate change has left some ecosystems more susceptible to flames. Warmer temperatures have intensified drought and dried out forests.

The resulting devastation often includes climatic changes and the exacerbation of the greenhouse effect. To mitigate these negative impacts, it is crucial to identify forest fires early on. This study suggests a wireless sensor network system that can detect forest fires at their initial stages.

### How forest fire works?
Wildfires can fizzle out quickly or spread uncontrolled, consuming thousands of acres of land in a matter of hours. But the intensity and movement of a wildfire ultimately depends on three factors:
* fuel
* weather
* topography
These factors are collectively known as the "fire behavior triangle".

High temperatures and low humidity also dry out fuel sources, causing them to ignite and burn faster. This is why wildfires typically become more intense and spread fastest in the afternoon, when the air is hottest.

Common causes for wildfires include:
* Arson
* Campfires 
* Discarding lit cigarettes
* Improperly burning debris
* Playing with matches or fireworks
* Prescribed fires
However, sometimes Wildfires do sometimes occur naturally, either ignited by the sun's heat or a lightning strike.

Most fires have historically occurred between May and October. However, recent data has shown that the season is lengthening, with wildfires starting earlier in the year and lasting well into the fall and winter months.

Some ecosystems were hit harder by nighttime activity than others. For instance, nighttime fire detections were dominant in temperate evergreen forests, where 38 percent of fire detections occurred at night.

### Actual forest fire system
The Copernicus Emergency Management Services is the fire forest system used in Europe. Similar to the other active fire maps, the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) uses MODIS and VIIRS to track thermal anomalies. As part of their current situation viewer, it assesses the burnt area of the forest fire with a polygon extent. Also, it provides an analysis of seasonal trends and the number of fires by European Union countries. For fire prevention managers, this platform forecasts fire danger levels based on meteorological predictions. The program cost â‚¬5,421 billion (2021-2027), Copernicus (io non lo metterei). Copernicus initial operations began in 2011. Copernicus became fully operational in 2014.
