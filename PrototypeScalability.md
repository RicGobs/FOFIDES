## Architecture
Wildfires spread at an average of 14.27 miles per hour. However, this can vary hugely depending on a number of factors, such as weather conditions, fuel type, and terrain.
23 km/h worst case conditions. 6,38889 m/s. When is already big.
My test are done with the lighter so I will use this distance.

I have thought an height of 1.73 but it is too much, fire too big.

The detection distance of the flame of lighter is 100 cm.

In the end, I have scaled the architecture.
