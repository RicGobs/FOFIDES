# Prototype Scalability

This file is for the future of the project: ideas and future applications, which has not already implemented.

## Scalability of the Prototype using LoRa

Starting from the small model of the infrastructure

It is possible to scale the schema with more nodes. In the future the system, due to energy efficiency, will use LoRa Protocol. So in the next images, I will show the infrastructure with LoRa.

A problem of this infrastructure is that with more nodes, it would be intelligent to create a cluster environment, in which the father of the cluster uses LoRa while the other elements of the cluster use a short range communication protocol (like Bluetooth-Low-Energy, BLE).

Here a possible scenario of fire detection.

## Integration with UAVs for firefighting
A possible future integration is using UAVs for firefighting. In particular the idea is building a system in which when an alarm arrives, a fleet of drones is sent to extinguish the fire.
